Great job completing the **Linux Troubleshooting Challenge**.

You covered:
- System navigation, logs, permissions
- systemd units and diagnostics
- IP addressing and routing
- Cron scheduling
- Disk usage quirks (deleted-but-open)
- Bash scripting and a minimal HTTP service

You can re-run any step or tweak your solutions to explore further.
